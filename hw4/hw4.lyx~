\begin_layout Section
Design a secure mutual authentication protocol based on a shared symmetric
 key.
 We also want to establish a session key, and we want perfect forward secrecy.
 Solve for a protocol that can establish this in 2 to 3 messages

\begin_layout Section
Consider the following mutual authentication protocol, where 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{ab}$
\end_inset

 is a shared symmetric key.

Give an attack Trudy can use to convince Bob that she is Alice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trudy could use a replay attack by sending 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm Alice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R+1$
\end_inset

 to Bob he would receive 
\begin_inset Formula $E(R+1,K_{AB})$
\end_inset

.
 He could then send 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm Alice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 to Bob after which he would respond to Bob with 
\begin_inset Formula $E(R+1,K_{ab})$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section
Consider the following protocol, where CLNT and SRVR are constants and session
 key 
\begin_inset Formula $K=h(S,R_{A},R_{B})$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does Alice authenticate Bob? Justify your answer
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Yes, Alice authenticated Bob because she sent 
\begin_inset Formula $\{S\}_{\text{Bob}}$
\end_inset

 , which could only be decrypeted by Bob.
 Bob decrypts this to get 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Bob then uses the hash of 
\begin_inset Formula $S,R_{A},R_{B}$
\end_inset

 to arrive at the session key.
 He then responds with the encryption of SRVR which only he could do given
 the need for 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does Bob authenticate Alice? Justify your answer
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

No, Bob does not authenticate Alice because neither of her responses contain
 anything that only Alice could compute.
 Trudy could provide their own 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, encrypt it for Bob, they could produce their session key since 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{B}$
\end_inset

 were transmitted in the clear.

\begin_layout Section
Kerberos

\begin_layout Enumerate
Why can Alice not remain anonymous when requesting a TGT from the KDC?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A Ticket Granting Ticket acts a users credentials.
 The KDC needs to know exactly who is making the request for the TGT to
 correctly provided it.
 The will TGT contain a session key and Alice's user ID amongst its contents.
 This is how the KDC maintains the state of Alice's authentication since
 the KDC is stateless in that the KDC does not maintain which users are
 logged in to the KDC.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Why can Alice remain anonymous in the sense of not needing to use her private
 key when requesting a ticket to Bob (what does she use instead and why
 is this sufficient)?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The TGT and the authenticator are enough to request a ticket to Bob.
 The TGT contains Alice's session key and user ID while the authenticator
 contains a timestamp and Alice's session key.
 Most of the information the KDC needs is in the TGT while the authenticator
 helps verify that the communication is fresh.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Why can Alice remain anonymous (not needing her private key) when she sends
 the “ticket to Bob” to Bob?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The ticket to Bob contains Alice's user ID and the shared key they will
 use in their communication.
 That is enough to for Bob to establish who Alice is and how to comminicate
 with Alice securely.

\begin_layout Section
Describe what the confused deputy problem is and what types of authorization
 approach would be susceptible to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that doesn't
 have permission to perform an action can coerce a more priveleged entity
 to perform the action.
 Access Control Lists, in particular, are susceptible to this approach.
